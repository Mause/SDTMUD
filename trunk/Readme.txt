This project was originally convieved in 2010, when i was assisting a friend in creating a simple non-networked MUD.
Unfornatly, i was forced to use side steps and "hacks" in order to make the coding simple and modular. Thus making it easier for my friend to understand it.
Once they were on track, i began pondering whether it would be possible to create an extensible framework that would be networked, and contain an approiate client and server, and also have the option of hosting many differently coded MUD worlds.
As of yet, it is not a true Multi User Domain, as all users roam their own copy of the requested world.
Though it has not yet been confirmed, there may be bugs pertaining from the interaction between instances of the same or similar programs running on the same machine under the same overruler.
